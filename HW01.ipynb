    "1.  Use graphical kinematics to determine the velocities and accelerations of the points (P, Q, etc. as labeled) in the systems illustrated here. You can define unit vectors as necessary, and draw in copies of the unit vectors and the magnitudes of the associated vectors, as demonstrated in class. Solution should be in the form of a drawing, which is optional to turn in (via uploaded image).  <img src=\"graphicalkinematics.png\" width=\"75%\"/>"

    "2.  <img src=\"HW01 joint angles with com.png\" width=\"20%\" align=\"right\"/>Jacobian relationships may be formed for a variety of kinematic transformations. The system at right has configuration described by two types of angles: Joint angles $\\theta_i$ and Segment angles $\\phi_i$. Here, joint angle $\\theta_i$ ($i=1,\\dots,4$ for toe through hip) describes segment $i$'s angle relative to neighboring segment $i-1$, with $\\theta_i$ increasing positively in the joint extension direction. Segment angle $\\phi_i$ describes segment $i$'s angle, increasing in the counter-clockwise direction relative to vertical. Of course, a variety of conventions are employed, and so it is helpful to develop transformations between different conventions.<br/><br/>\n",
    "The transformation between segment and joint angles looks something like $\\theta_4 = \\phi_4 - \\phi_3$. There is a Jacobian relationship between these angles.<br/><br/>\n",
    "Another Jacobian of interest is the one for the transformation from segment/joint angles to segment positions and orientations. A full description of translational position and angular orientation is called the \"pose,\" such as \n",

    "5. <img src=\"rimlesswheeldiagram.png\" width=\"40%\" align=\"right\"/>Simulate the stance phase of the rimless wheel model. The rimless wheel is a simple inverted pendulum, with equation of motion $\\ddot{\\theta} - \\frac{1}{(1+r_\\mathrm{gyr}^2)} \\sin(\\theta-\\gamma) = 0$, where the stance leg angle $\\theta$ is measured counter-clockwise with respect to the ground normal (i.e., not exactly vertical), and the ground has a downward slope of $\\gamma$. The simulation should start at $\\theta(0)=\\alpha$ and end at $\\theta(t_f)=-\\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is half the angle between the legs, and $t_f$ is the time at which the next leg contacts ground. Use the starter code `rimlesswheelstance_startercode`. An event function will be needed to terminate the simulation. Use parameter values $\\alpha=0.3$, $r_\\mathrm{gyr}=0$, $\\gamma=0.04$.\n",

    "  2. Sketch the trajectory of the states for a stance phase in state-space, $\\dot{\\theta}$ vs. $\\theta$, along with an array of state-derivatives indicated with arrows. Note that the ground slope causes the vector field to differ slightly from the normal inverted pendulum on level ground.\n",

The rimless wheel experiences a collision with ground, such that the angular velocity is altered: $\\dot{\\theta}(0+) = \\dot{\\theta}(0-) \\cos(2\\alpha)$ where $0-$ and $0+$ denote the time instances immediately before and after impact. After impact, the next leg's stance phase commences, with a new initial angle $\\alpha$. On your state-space diagram, indicate these two steps, and show how the entire stance phase, collision equation, and switch to a new leg all can yield a periodic trajectory."
