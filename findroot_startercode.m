function [xstar, cnvrg] = findroot(f, x0)
% FINDROOT  Finds the root of a vector function, with vector-valued x0.
%  
% xstar = findroot(f, x0) performs a Newton search and returns xstar,
%   the root of the function f, starting with initial guess x0. The
%   function will typically be expressed with a function handle, e.g. 
%   @f.

% parameter structure for root-finding
parms.dxtol = 1e-6;      % default tolerance for min change in x

% We will take steps to improve on x, while monitoring
% the change dx, and stopping when it becomes small
dx = Inf;          % initial dx is large
iter = 0;          % count the iterations we go through
x = x0(:);         % start at this initial guess (force to be column)
fprevious = f(x0); % use to compare changes in function value
df = Inf;          % change in f is initialized as large

% Loop through the refinements, checking to make sure that x and f
% change by some minimal amount, and that we haven't exceeded
% the maximum number of iterations

  % df (change in f(x)) exceeds its tolerance, and whether
  % dx (change in x) exceeds its tolerance
        
  % Here is the main Newton step
  J =  % FILL in code here to calculate the gradient or jacobian
  dx = % FILL in this line to solve for the (vector) dx (change in x)
  x = x + dx; % Apply the calculated step to form the next x value

  % Update information about changes
